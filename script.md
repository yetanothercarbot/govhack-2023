The past few years here in South-East Queensland have shown just how unpredictable weather can get, ad has demonstrated just important it is to be prepared. This is where our app, SEQPrepare, comes in. Developed with a focus on south-east Queensland, it allows residents to see what their current risk is (based on nearby fires, the day's fire danger rating, and current water heights), to understand their risk profile (based on previous flood and fire events) and to be guided through creating a tailored survival plan that is based upon your specific risks. For example, this location is generally at risk of flooding and based on this, the app suggests that the user stocks up on sandbags for prep. 

Let's talk about the implementation details. Our hack comprises of a cross-platform mobile app developed in Flutter, which interacts with an API server. This server performs co-ordinate to address matching, proxies and caches queries for real-time data, and returns long-term data from the datasets stored on it. The datasets we use come from every level of government, including from the Bureau of Meteorology, Queensland Fire and Service, and several councils in South-East Queensland.

The app is not yet fully featured as we had envisioned - this is the first time creating a mobile app for either of us, and as such it took a while to learn the frameworks. However, you can give our app a try in its current guise by pointing your browser at [seqprepare.xyz](https://seqprepare.xyz), or following the instructions in our documentation.
